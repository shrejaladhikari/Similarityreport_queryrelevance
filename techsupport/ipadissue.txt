@813459 Ever since I updated my iPad to the latest iOS version, the touchscreen has been acting up and becoming unresponsive at random times. Iâ€™ve tried rebooting the device and adjusting the touch sensitivity settings, but nothing seems to help. This is really frustrating, especially when I'm trying to take notes or browse the web. Has anyone else experienced this issue after the update? Any suggestions on how to resolve it would be greatly appreciated!

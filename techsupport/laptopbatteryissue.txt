@307842 I’m having a problem with my laptop's battery. It drains really quickly, even when I’m not using it heavily. I've checked the battery health, and it shows that it's still in good condition, but it only lasts about two hours on a full charge. I’ve also tried adjusting the power settings to save energy and closing unnecessary apps, but nothing seems to help. I’m worried that the battery might be failing, but I’d like to explore any other possibilities first. Has anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?

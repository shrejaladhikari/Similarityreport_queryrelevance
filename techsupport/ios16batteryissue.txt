I updated my iPhone to iOS 16.4, and now the battery performance is much worse. I used to charge my phone overnight and not worry about it during the day, but now it’s dropping fast even with light usage. I’ve turned off all unnecessary features, but it hasn’t made a difference. Has anyone else had this problem?

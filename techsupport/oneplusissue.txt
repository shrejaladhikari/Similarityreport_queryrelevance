My OnePlus device’s battery used to be great, but after the latest Android 14 update, it feels like it’s draining way too quickly. Even with battery-saving features turned on and restricted background apps, I still can’t get through a full day. I’ve even reset the phone, but the battery life hasn’t improved. Any suggestions?

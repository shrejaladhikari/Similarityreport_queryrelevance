I’ve been having major battery issues after upgrading to the latest version of iOS. I’m not sure if it’s a bug in the system or if there’s something wrong with my phone, but I went from charging once a day to twice or even three times. I’ve already done everything – from tweaking settings to reinstalling the update – but it doesn’t help. Any advice?

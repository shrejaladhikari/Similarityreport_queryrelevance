The latest Android update on my Pixel has made my battery life terrible. Even when I’m not using the phone much, it seems to drain incredibly fast. I've turned off Wi-Fi scanning, location tracking, and even tried switching to dark mode to save power, but the battery still barely lasts a full day. Is anyone else having the same issue?

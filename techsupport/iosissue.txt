After upgrading my iPhone to the latest iOS, I've noticed a sharp drop in battery performance. Before the update, I could use my phone all day without charging, but now it drains within a few hours. I've already tried disabling unnecessary notifications, closing background apps, and reducing screen brightness, but nothing seems to help. Is anyone else experiencing this with the latest iOS update?"
